Goal is to identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

Both models are build using CNN and gives 99% accuracy.
Kaggle_digit_recognition.ipynb : Kaggle data link is give in the file

mnist_digit_recognition.ipynb : Data used from API keras.dataset.
In this model Callbacks is used to stop training once required accuracy is achieved/
Also you can check, incorrectly guessed images by the Model.
